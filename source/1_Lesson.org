- A mechanism is a device that takes an input motion or force and outputs a different motion or force.
- Gears trains, for instance, are a type of mechanism.
[[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Gears_animation.gif]]
- This gear train takes rotary motion as input, and outputs rotary motion. The difference between the input and output is the speed and direction of the motion.
- In this project you're going to be looking at different type mechanism called a Cam Mechanism.

- Cam mechanisms turn rotary motion (round and round) into reciprocating motion (up and down)

- A cam mechanism is made up of three main parts: cam, slide and follower. In the image below, the slide (or guide) is the red ring.
[[https://msc-ks3technology.wikispaces.com/file/view/Cam3D.png/32381945/Cam3D.png]]
- The cam rotates continually. The follower is a rod that rests on the edge of the turning cam.
- The follower moves up and down, but can't move to the side because of the slide or guide.
- This means the cam follower can only:
  - Rise
  - Fall
  - Dwell

- We can draw what are know as =displacement graphs= for any cam mechanism.
- A displacement graph shows how the follower moves as the cam rotates.
- Below is a quick sketch of a displacement graph with the cam drawn beside it.
[[file:img/displacement-graph.jpg]]
- The graph clearly shows how the follower =rises=, =dwells= for a small ammount of time, =falls= and then =dwells= for a longer period.
** Badge It - Silver

- For each of the cams listed below, try to =roughly= sketch the displacement graphs you think you would get.
  1. Elliptical cam
  2. Eccentric cam
  3. Drop cam

- Using SolidWorks, produce two of the Cams below (Not Eccentric, Round or Ellipse though).
- The Cam's diameter must not exceed 60mm.
[[file:img/cams.jpg]]
- Don't worry about putting the hole in the middle, we'll do that later.
- Screenshot your finished sketches including the part where it states your sketch is fully defined.
** Badge It - Platinum

- SolidWorks can be used to produce animations.
- Independently (or with a little help from your teacher), produce an animation of one of your cams rotating.
